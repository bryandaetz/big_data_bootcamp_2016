# Workshop code for Santa Clara Global Data Conference 2017

This is a cloned repo from a NLP workshop hosted by Frank D. Evans that I attended at the Santa Clara Global Data Science Convention.
The original complete.R code was throwing me errors for some reason so I made a few changes to it and uploaded the new script as the 
StateofUnion.R file. 

The project uses NLP to look at all the State of the Union addresses from the past 70 years (not including 2017).
